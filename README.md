# Genetic Algorithm in Rust

This project is a simple implementation of a genetic algorithm in Rust. It uses a population of individuals, each with a genome, to evolve towards a target string.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Rust
- Cargo

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Toudonou/string-generation.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd string-generation
```

Build the project:

```bash
cargo build
```

Run the project:

```bash
cargo run
```

## Usage

To run the genetic algorithm, you need to pass a target string as a command line argument. The program will then evolve a population of individuals towards that target string.

```bash
cargo run -- "your target string"
```
